## Build
Required golang 1.13+
```sh
# build binary
git clone https://github.com/lomik/graphite-clickhouse.git
cd graphite-clickhouse
make
```

## Installation
1. Setup [Yandex ClickHouse](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse) and [carbon-clickhouse](https://github.com/lomik/carbon-clickhouse)
2. Setup and configure `graphite-clickhouse`
3. Add graphite-clickhouse `host:port` to graphite-web [CLUSTER_SERVERS](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-local-settings.html#cluster-configuration)

## Configuration
Create `/etc/graphite-clickhouse/rollup.xml` with same content as for ClickHouse. Short sample:
```xml
<graphite_rollup>
        <default>
                <function>avg</function>
                <retention>
                        <age>0</age>
                        <precision>60</precision>
                </retention>
                <retention>
                        <age>2592000</age>
                        <precision>3600</precision>
                </retention>
        </default>
</graphite_rollup>
```

For complex ClickHouse queries you might need to increase default query_max_size. To do that add following line to `/etc/clickhouse-server/users.xml` for the user you are using:
```xml
<!-- Default is 262144 -->
<max_query_size>10485760</max_query_size>
```

### Special headers processing

Some HTTP headers are processed specially by the service

#### Request headers

*Grafana headers*: `X-Dashboard-Id`, `X-Grafana-Org-Id`, and `X-Panel-Id` are logged and passed further to the ClickHouse.

*Debug headers*:

- `X-Gch-Debug-External-Data` - when this header is set to anything and every of `directory`, `directory-perm`, and `external-data-perm` parameters in `[debug]` is set and valid, service will save the dump of external data tables in the directory for debug output.

#### Response headers

- `X-Gch-Request-Id` - the current request ID.

## Run on same host with old graphite-web 0.9.x
By default graphite-web won't connect to CLUSTER_SERVER on localhost. Cheat:
```python
class ForceLocal(str):
    def split(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return ["8.8.8.8", "8080"]

CLUSTER_SERVERS = [ForceLocal("127.0.0.1:9090")]
```
