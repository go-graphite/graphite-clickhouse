# Configuration

## Common  `[common]`

### Finder cache

Specify what storage to use for finder cache. This cache stores finder results (metrics find/tags autocomplete/render).

Supported cache types:
 - `mem` - will use integrated in-memory cache. Not distributed. Fast.
 - `memcache` - will use specified memcache servers. Could be shared. Slow.
 - `null` - disable cache

Extra options:
 - `size_mb` - specify max size of cache, in MiB
 - `defaultTimeoutSec` - specify default cache ttl.
 - `shortTimeoutSec` - cache ttl for short duration intervals of render queries (duration <= shortDuration && now-until <= 61) (if 0, disable this cache)
 - `findTimeoutSec` - cache ttl for finder/tags autocompleter queries (if 0, disable this cache)
 - `shortDuration` - maximum duration for render queries, which use shortTimeoutSec duration

### Example
```yaml
[common.find-cache]
type = "memcache"
size_mb = 0
memcachedServers = [ "127.0.0.1:1234", "127.0.0.2:1235" ]
defaultTimeoutSec = 10800
shortTimeoutSec = 300
findTimeoutSec = 600
```

## ClickHouse `[clickhouse]`

### URL `url`
Detailed explanation of ClickHouse HTTP interface is given in [documentation](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/http). It's recommended to create a dedicated read-only user for graphite-clickhouse.

Example: `url = "http://graphite:qwerty@localhost:8123/?readonly=2&log_queries=1"`

Some useful parameters:

- [log_queries=1](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-log-queries): all queries will be logged in the `system.query_log` table. Useful for debug.
- [readonly=2](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/settings/permissions-for-queries/#settings_readonly): do not change data on the server
- [max_rows_to_read=200000000](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/settings/query-complexity/#max-rows-to-read): useful if you want to prevent too broad requests
- [cancel_http_readonly_queries_on_client_close=1](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#cancel-http-readonly-queries-on-client-close): cancel DB query when request is canceled.

All these and more settings can be set in clickhouse-server configuration as user's profile settings.

Useless settings:

- `max_query_size`: at the moment [external data](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/special/external-data/) is used, the query length is relatively small and always less than the default [262144](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_query_size)
- `max_ast_elements`: the same
- `max_execution_time`: with `cancel_http_readonly_queries_on_client_close=1` and `data-timeout = "1m"` it's already covered.

### Query multi parameters (for overwrite default url and data-timeout)

For queries with duration (until - from) >= 72 hours, use custom url and data-timeout

```
url = "http://graphite:qwerty@localhost:8123/?readonly=2&log_queries=1&max_rows_to_read=102400000&max_result_bytes=12800000&max_threads=2"
data-timeout = "30s"

query-params = [
  {
    duration = "72h",
    url = "http://graphite:qwerty@localhost:8123/?readonly=2&log_queries=1&max_rows_to_read=1024000000&max_result_bytes=128000000&max_threads=1",
    data-timeout = "60s"
  }
]
```

### Query limiter for prevent database overloading (limit concurrent/maximum incomming requests)

For prevent database overloading incomming requests (render/find/autocomplete) can be limited.
If executing max-concurrent requests, next request will be wait for free slot until index-timeout reached
If wait max-queries requests, for new request error returned immediately.

```
url = "http://graphite:qwerty@localhost:8123/?readonly=2&log_queries=1&max_rows_to_read=102400000&max_result_bytes=12800000&max_threads=2"
render-max-queries = 500
render-max-concurrent = 10
find-max-queries = 100
find-max-concurrent = 10
tags-max-queries = 100
tags-max-concurrent = 10

query-params = [
  {
    duration = "72h",
    url = "http://graphite:qwerty@localhost:8123/?readonly=2&log_queries=1&max_rows_to_read=1024000000&max_result_bytes=128000000&max_threads=1",
    data-timeout = "60s"
    max-queries = 100,
    max-concurrent = 4
  }
]

user-limits = {
  "alerting" = {
    max-queries = 100,
    max-concurrent = 5
  }
}

```

### Index table
See [index table](./index-table.md) documentation for details.

### Index reversed queries tuning
By default the daemon decides to make a direct or reversed request to the [index table](./index-table.md) based on a first and last glob node in the metric. It choose the most long path to reduce readings. Additional examples can be found in [tests](../finder/index_test.go).

You can overwrite automatic behavior with `index-reverse`. Valid values are `"auto", direct, "reversed"`

If you need fine tuning for different paths, you can use `[[clickhouse.index-reverses]]` to set behavior per metrics' `prefix`, `suffix` or `regexp`.

### Tags table
By default, tags are stored in the tagged-table on the daily basis. If a metric set doesn't change much, that leads to situation when the same data stored multiple times.
To prevent uncontrolled growth and reduce the amount of data stored in the tagged-table, the `tagged-use-daily` parameter could be set to `false` and table definition could be changed to something like:
```
CREATE TABLE graphite_tagged (
  Date Date,
  Tag1 String,
  Path String,
  Tags Array(String),
  Version UInt32
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(Date)
ORDER BY (Tag1, Path);
```

For restrict costly seriesByTag (may be like `seriesByTag('name=~test.*.*.rabbitmq_overview.connections')` or `seriesByTag('name=test.*.*.rabbitmq_overview.connections')`) use tags-min-in-query parameter.
For restrict costly autocomplete queries use tags-min-in-autocomplete parameter.

set for require at minimum 1 eq argument (without wildcards)
`tags-min-in-query=1`


`ReplacingMergeTree(Date)` prevent broken tags autocomplete with default `ReplacingMergeTree(Version)`, when write to the past.

### ClickHouse aggregation
For detailed description of `max-data-points` and `internal-aggregation` see [aggregation documentation](./aggregation.md).

## Data tables `[[data-table]]`

### Rollup
The rollup configuration is used for a proper  metrics pre-aggregation. It contains two rules types:

- retention for point per time range
- aggregation function for a values

Historically, the way to define the config was `rollup-conf = "/path/to/the/conf/with/graphite_rollup.xml"`. The format is the same as [graphite_rollup](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/graphitemergetree/#rollup-configuration) scheme for ClickHouse server.

For a quite long time it's recommended to use `rollup-conf = "auto"` to get the configuration from remote ClickHouse server. It will update itself on each `rollup-auto-interval` (1 minute by default) or once on startup if set to "0s".

If you don't use a `GraphiteMergeTree` family engine, you can still use `rollup-conf = "auto"` by setting `rollup-auto-table="graphiteMergeTreeTable"` and get the proper config. In this case `graphiteMergeTreeTable` is a dummy table associated with proper [graphite_rollup](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/graphitemergetree/#rollup-configuration). The cases when you may need it:

- ReplacingMergeTree engine
- Distributed engine
- Materialized view

It's possible as well to set `rollup-conf = "none"`. Then values from `rollup-default-precision` and `rollup-default-function` will be used.

#### Additional rollup tuning for reversed data tables
When `reverse = true` is set for data-table, there are two possibles cases for [graphite_rollup](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/graphitemergetree/#rollup-configuration):

- Original regexps are used, like `^level_one.level_two.suffix$`
- Reversed regexps are used, like `^suffix.level_two.level_one$`

Depends on it for having a proper retention and aggregation you must additionally set `rollup-use-reverted = true` for the first case and `rollup-use-reverted = false` for the second.

#### Additional tuning tagged find for seriesByTag and autocomplete
Only one tag used as filter for index field Tag1, see graphite_tagged table [structure](https://github.com/lomik/
